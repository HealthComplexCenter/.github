## Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the Copenhagen Health Complexity Center 

The Copenhagen Health Complexity Center is dedicated to advancing the understanding and management of complex public health challenges, particularly focusing on young adult health, healthcare inequalities, theoretical and methodological development in complexity science, and outreach and public dissemination concerning public health complexity.

We are a group of epidemiologists, data scientists, systems scientists, bioinformaticians, curators, and researchers in related fields, collaborating on interdisciplinary projects, with the vision to use a complexity lens and multi-faceted scientific approaches to impact our societies positively.

Through collaborations with professional communication partners, the Center aims to effectively communicate its findings and promote a greater understanding of the complex issues surrounding public health. For more information on our research, teaching, and events, please visit [our websit](healthcomplex.dk).
